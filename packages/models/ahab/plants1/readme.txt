Here's a bush and a tree that work in my map.
The mesh is my own, but the texture was made by someone else and put up on the
web for anyone to use. The main page of the wiki is here:
http://blender-archi.tuxfamily.org/Main_Page

and it states all content on the page uses free licenses..
In the case of the 'tree' texture, it was made by Yorik and is under CC-by license
Here's his home pageand his "greenhouse" page
http://yorik.orgfree.com/
http://yorik.orgfree.com/greenhouse.html

more textures can be easily made using either:

 gen3 in blender       http://www.geocities.com/bgen3/
or
 ngPlant               http://ngplant.sourceforge.net/

As either one of the above makes full hi-poly trees, they might also be a source of a normal map even. But's for after I get more things made. ( I need a train, dammit! and boxcars and a flatcar and a caboose )


the md3.cfg was cut'n'paste from an existing tree mapmodel and used until I figure out exactly what each command does concerning how cube2 handles alpha planes. I'm really interested in md3bumpmap to try and make flat alpha planes appear to have more substance.

the tree has 92 tris
the bush has 73 tris

I hope to add more textures that can be used by either mesh ( as well as future meshes ) for a variety of trees.
I'll work on regular plants soon.
