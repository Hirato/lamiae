Here is a simple lift for the Sandbox project

lift.md3		
lift.jpg

the metal texture is a procedural texture baked onto the mesh and is my own creation
the wood texture is form OpenfootageNETwood5.jpg from the kidrpg OF texture package
(so I am assuming its okay for use in the game)

I can change the wood texture if needed
I hope to add a normal map with woodgrain, gear and bolt detail in the future.
